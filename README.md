As mt first keyboard, i try to design a small keyborad for number zone.
Not as same as regular keyboard, i tend to use stm32 instead of atmage.

Finish my PCB and successfully weld that. But what is so stupid is that i welded my shaft seat upside down, which led to i cannot put my shaft to my PCB. So i have to correct this problem.
